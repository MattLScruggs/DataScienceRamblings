From time to time, I grow curious about things in our world, and explore them with data.

This is a record of my data science curiosities.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/MattLScruggs/DataScience/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
